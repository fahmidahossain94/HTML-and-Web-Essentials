# Module3-Practical – Enhanced Webpage with Navigation, Divs, and Text Formatting

## Objective
Extend my Module 2 profile page by adding:
- A navigation menu
- Structured content with `<div>` elements
- Text formatting using HTML tags and inline CSS
- A clickable email link
- An extra practice section

## What I built / learned
- How to create and style a navigation bar with hover effects
- Using `<div>` elements to separate content into sections
- Applying text formatting tags like `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<span>` and inline styles
- Creating a clickable email link using `mailto:`
- Adding an extra section for practicing line-through and text alignment

## How to run
- Open `index.html` in any web browser
- Or view it live on GitHub Pages:

## Notes
- I kept some inline CSS as practice, as required in this module  
- The **new section** shows line-through formatting  
- My email link is clickable (`mailto:`) and styled with a CSS class  
- The navigation and footer give the page a professional layout
