Create a simple personal profile web page using HTML and CSS.  
The page should include:

- How to apply basic CSS styling for layout, fonts, colors, and spacing

## How to run
- Open `index.html` in any web browser
- Or view it live on GitHub Pages:

## Notes
- I used my own photo for the profile image  
- This was my first time linking GitHub and LinkedIn to my webpage  
- Next time, I might experiment with more CSS styling to improve the design
